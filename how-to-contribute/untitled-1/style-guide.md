# GuÃ­a de Estilo

_**From the GitHub Manual of Style, which this style guide inherits from:**_

> Words are an important part of how software works. Just as we have a style guide for our code, we have a style guide for our tone and our voice. Even though there may be dozens of people creating a product, it should still sound like we speak in one consistent voice.
>
> In other words, the way we write is just as important as the way we design. Consider these things when writing copy.

## Content principles

All written content should follow these principles:

* **Approachability:** Don't assume the reader has prior knowledge
* **Brevity:** Keep it simple, link to outside content for deeper dives
* **Curation:** Amplify community best practices vs. any individual's point of view

Content should maintain a light-hearted and welcoming tone. Open source is fun! Readers should feel inspired, not discouraged, by the tone of your writing, and they should trust you to help them get started.

## Mentions

When referring to people that use GitHub, use @mentions of their username instead of their full name.

* ðŸ˜„ As @Ekkyz put it...
* ðŸ˜¢ As Ekkyz put it...

When referring to a project on GitHub, link to the repository so others can dive deeper, if they choose.
